**Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Ruben**
  I'm a backend developer in training and a second-year coding adventurer at the University of Oslo. 
  Iâ€™m all about building systems so efficient, they might just outpace my caffeine intake.
  
  ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Enhancing my skills in backend development.
  ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python and Java.
  ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: Backend development, programming languages, and how to survive the wild journey of transitioning into tech â€” preferably with snacks.
  âš¡ Fun fact: If Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably at the gym or wearing my gaming headset.
